# Changelog

This changelog is not a typical source code changelog. It is used primarily to keep track of user-facing new features and bugs fixed. This helps build the release notes for the app stores as well as the GitHub releases. It's also useful for people to understand all the new stuff they get when upgrading to the latest version of the app!
