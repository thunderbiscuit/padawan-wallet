        Receiving bitcoin

        You will find that Padawan only uses testnet bitcoins. Make sure you never send it real bitcoins!\n\nThe way to receive bitcoin is typically to ask your wallet software—in our case, Padawan—to generate what is called a _receive address_. Deep down, this address is simply a really, really big number. But to make sure it is easy to share, copy/paste, and scan, we display that address in one of two common forms; either a string of numbers and letters that looks like this one: \`tb1lkjs\`, or a QR code that looks like this:\n\nThe two formats above actually refer to the same address.\n\nTo receive bitcoin, you would either ask the person trying to send you the coins to scan the QR code displayed on your screen when you generate an address (if the person is nearby), or you would copy the address string generated by the wallet and paste it in a message to them, preferably on a secure and encrypted chat. You can do that by touching the address on the screen. The wallet will offer you to put that address on the clipboard for you.\n\nIt\'s very important that the _exact_ right address be used by the person trying to send you bitcoins. QR codes are a good way to prevent errors for that, and using the copy/paste function of your phone\'s clipboard is another way to do it. Still, you should always double check that the complete address was read/transferred to the person trying to send you bitcoin! A common way to do that is to read aloud the letters/numbers, or, for smaller transactions, to look at the first 5 to 10 characters and the last 5 to 10 characters of an address and verify that they are the same.
