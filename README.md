Padawan is a testnet-only bitcoin wallet that will teach you how to use... bitcoin wallets! Padawan aims to be a self-study tool, getting its users acquainted with the usual workflow and basic jargon of mobile wallets in a risk-free environment perfect for experimentation and learning (testnet).

We think testnet is an underused resource outside of software development circles, and believe it can be leveraged for bitcoin-curious people everywhere. Testnet offers most of the complexity of mainnet at no risk! Practice your wallet skills, learn about transaction fees, mempools, and recovery phrases, all without the pressure of handling mainnet bitcoins! Perfect for people of all ages, it's completely free and will send you testnet satoshis to play with right from the get go.

### Building and running Padawan
To build and run the app from source, you'll need:
- Android Studio
- A phone with Android 8 (Android Oreo, API level 26) or above with USB debugging activated OR an emulator on your development machine.

### Building and running Padawan iOS
To build and run the iOS app, youâ€™ll need:
- `Xcode`
- `XcodeGen` to generate PadawanWallet.xcodeproj, [see](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
- `SwiftGen` to generate Strings, Fonts and Assets, [see](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen)

#### Configuring the project
